    <p>In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of points in a contest.</p>
    If the bdi element is not supported in the browser, the username of the Arabic user would confuse the 
    text (the bidirectional algorithm would put the colon and the numer "90" next to the word "User"
    rather than next to the word "points").
</p>
<ul>
    <li>User <bdi>John</bdi>:60 points</li>
    <li>User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>:80 points</li>
    <li>User <bdi>#$%%%$</bdi>:60 points</li>
</ul>
